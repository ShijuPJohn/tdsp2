     - Mean: 3.21, with a standard deviation of 0.80, conveys a similar trend to overall ratings.
   - **Correlation Findings**: A strong correlation of 0.826 between overall and quality ratings indicates that higher quality often translates to better overall ratings.

### 7. **Repeatability of Ratings**
